# Personal Website

One of the projects in [CS50's 8th week](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/8/) was to create a simple webpage about myself, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

After doing the initial pages, I realized this could be developed into a Portfolio Website. And so it was.

As I didn't had much experience with design, I've based myself on the structure described in [this video](https://youtu.be/3e8p0R5-b5A?si=Lbo8mYa5O8WnDrnL).
